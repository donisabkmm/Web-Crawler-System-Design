## Web Crawler System Design Outline:

### 1. RANKING AND INDEXING

#### Objective:

After crawling and extracting content, the crawler needs to rank and index the data to make it searchable and prioritize future crawls.

#### Content Ranking:

Implement algorithms to rank content based on relevance, authority, freshness, and other factors. This cloud involve using PageRank, keyword frequency, topic modeling techniques        
Integrate ML models to improve ranking accuracy over time by learning from user interactions and search queries

#### Indexing:

Create the searchable index of the crawled content using the tools like ELASTICSEARCH or APACHE SOLR. This index will facilitate fast retrieval of data for search engines or other applications.
Implement inverted indexing, where each word in the document is mapped to its location in the index, allowing for efficient search operations
consider building separate indices for different content types(eg: text, images, videos) to optimize search performance

### 2. FIXED SCHEDULE TO UPDATE THE INDEX

#### Objective:

Regularly update the index to ensure that it reflects the latest content from the web

#### Scheduling  Strategy:

Implement a fixed schedule or cron jobs to initiate crawling and updating the index at regular intervals. For example, news sites may need daily updates, while static content can be updated less frequently
Use a priority-based approach where high-importance or frequently updated pages are crawled more than less dynamic content

#### Incremental Indexing:

Instead of rebuilding the entire index with every crawl, implement incremental indexing, where only the changes (new or updated content) are added to the index. This approach saves time and computational Resources.
Monitor changes in content (Eg: content hash or last modified date) to decide whether an update to the index is necessary

### 3. URL DISCOVERY AND MANAGEMENT

#### Objective:

Efficiently discover and manage URLS to optimize the crawling process.

#### Seed URLS:

Start with a list of seed URLs to initiate the crawling process. These should be well-known, authoritative websites in the target domain

#### Dynamic URL Discovery:

As the crawler navigates through pages, extract new URLs dynamically and add them to the URL frontier. This helps in expanding the crawl coverage
Handle dynamic URLs( e.g, URLs generated via JavaScript) by using headless browsers like Puppeteer to render pages and extract URLs

#### Duplicate Handling:

Implement mechanisms to avoid revisiting the same URLs (duplicates) by maintaining a history of crawled URLs or using a bloom filter.

### 4. POLITENESS AND THROTTLING

#### Objective:
Ensure that the crawler operates ethically and does not overwhelm target websites.

#### Respect for Robots.txt:

Always check the `robots.txt` file of each website to repect the rules set by webmasters regarding which parts of the site can be crawled.

#### Rate limiting:
Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests sent to a website within a given time frame. This prevents server overload and reduces the likelihood of getting blocked.

#### Politeness Delays:

Introduce random delays between requests to avoid patterns that might be flagged as aggressive crawling behavior.

### 5. CONTENT PARSING AND EXTRACTION

#### Objective:
Extract relevant data from web pages in a structured format.
       
#### HTML Parsing:

Use libraries like BeautifulSoap, lxml or scrapy to parse HTML content and extract necessary elements such as titles, headings, metadata and hyperlinks

#### Structured Data Extraction:

If available, extract structured data (Eg: JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa) to get rich metadata about the content. This is  particularly used for semantic web applications.

#### Handling Multimedia:

Extract and store multimedia content like images, videos and embedded objects. Ensure that media files are stored in a format that allows for efficient  retrieval and processing.

### 6. SCALABILITY AND DISTRIBUTED CRAWLING

#### Objective:

Scale the crawling process to handle large volumes of data and diverse web content.

#### Distributed Crawling:

Deploy the crawler across multiple machines or use cloud-based services to distribute the workload. Tools like Apache Nutch or custom solutions with distributed task queues(E.g Celery, RabbitMQ) can be used.

#### Load Balancing:

Implement load balancing to evenly distribute crawling tasks across multiple servers or nodes, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed.

#### Fault Tolerance:

Incorporate fault tolerance mechanisms to handle server failures, network issues, and timeouts. This may involve retry logic, backup systems and stateful checkpoints.

### 7. DATA STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT

#### Objective:

Efficiently store and manage the vast amount of data collected by the crawler.

#### Database Selection:

Choose appropriate storage solutions based on the nature of the data. For instance, use NoSQL DB like mongodb for unstructured data or relational db like MYSQL for structured content.

#### Data Partitioning

Implement data partitioning and sharding to manage large datasets acroos multiple servers, ensuing scability and quick access

#### Archiving and Compression

Store older or less frequently accessed data in compressed formats or move it to archival storage to save space and reduce costs.

### 8. MONITORING AND REPORTING

#### Objective: 
Efficiently store and manage the vast amount of data collected by the crawler

#### Real-Time Monitoring:
Implement real time monitoring dashboards to track the crawler's activity, including the number of pages crawled, error rates, responsive times, and throughput.

#### Error logging:
Log errors encountered during the crawling process, such as failed requests, parsing errors, or storage issues. Use these logs to diagonse and fix issues promptly.

#### Performance
Collect and analyze performance metrics to optimize crawling strtegies, such as adjusting the depth of crawling, updating schedules, or tuning the crawler's configuration.


### 9. COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS

#### Objective:
Ensure the crawler operates within legel and ethical bounderies.

#### Legal Compliance: 
Make sure that the crawling activities comply with legal regualtions, including data protection laws(e.g GDPR) and copyright laws.

#### User Privacy:
Avoid collecting sensitive or personally identifiable information unless explicitly required and permitted. Implement anonymization techniques where applicable.

#### Ethical Crawling:
Be trasparent about your crawling activities. Consider informing webmasters or providing an option for them to opt-out if they do not wish to have their site crawled.


### 10. ADAPTIVE CRAWLING AND ML INTEGRATION

#### Objective:
Enhance the crawlers efficieny and intelligence using Machine Learning.

#### Adaptive Crawling:
Using ML models to predict the relevence or importance of a page before crawling it. This can optimize resources by prioritizing high-volume content.

#### Content Classification:
Implement classifier that categorize content on the fly, enabling the crawler to focus on specific types of content (E.g. news, blog, academic papers).

#### Continuous Learning:
 Continuously train models on new data to adapt to changes in web content and crawling strategies, improving accuracy and performance over time.
