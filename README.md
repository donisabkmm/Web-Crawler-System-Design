# Web-Crawler-System-Design


## Web Crawler Design Outline:

### 1. RANKING AND INDEXING

Objective:

After crawling and extracting content, the crawler needs to rank and index the data to make it searchable and prioritize future crawls.

        

Content Ranking:

    Implement algorithms to rank content based on relevance, authority, freshness, and other factors. This cloud involve using PageRank, keyword frequency, topic modeling techniques        
    Integrate ML models to improve ranking accuracy over time by learning from user interactions and search queries

Indexing:

    Create the searchable index of the crawled content using the tools like ELASTICSEARCH or APACHE SOLR. This index will facilitate fast retrieval of data for search engines or other applications.
    Implement inverted indexing, where each word in the document is mapped to its location in the index, allowing for efficient search operations
    consider building separate indices for different content types(eg: text, images, videos) to optimize search performance

### 2. FIXED SCHEDULE TO UPDATE THE INDEX

Objective:

Regularly update the index to ensure that it reflects the latest content from the web

Scheduling  Strategy:

    Implement a fixed schedule or cron jobs to initiate crawling and updating the index at regular intervals. For example, news sites may need daily updates, while static content can be updated less frequently
    Use a priority-based approach where high-importance or frequently updated pages are crawled more than less dynamic content

Incremental Indexing:

    Instead of rebuilding the entire index with every crawl, implement incremental indexing, where only the changes (new or updated content) are added to the index. This approach saves time and computational Resources.
    Monitor changes in content (Eg: content hash or last modified date) to decide whether an update to the index is necessary

### 3. URL DISCOVERY AND MANAGEMENT

Objective:

        Efficiently discover and manage URLS to optimize the crawling process.

Seed URLS:

Start with a list of seed URLs to initiate the crawling process. These should be well-known, authoritative websites in the target domain

        

Dynamic URL Discovery:

     As the crawler navigates through pages, extract new URLs dynamically and add them to the URL frontier. This helps in expanding the crawl coverage
     Handle dynamic URLs( e.g, URLs generated via JavaScript) by using headless browsers like Puppeteer to render pages and extract URLs

Duplicate Handling:

Implement mechanisms to avoid revisiting the same URLs (duplicates) by maintaining a history of crawled URLs or using a bloom filter.

### 4. POLITENESS AND THROTTLING

        

Objective:

        Ensure that the crawler operates ethically and does not overwhelm target websites.

        

Respect for Robots.txt:

Always check the `robots.txt` file of each website to repect the rules set by webmasters regarding which parts of the site can be crawled.

        

Rate limiting:

Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests sent to a website within a given time frame. This prevents server overload and reduces the likelihood of getting blocked.

        

Politeness Delays:

Introduce random delays between requests to avoid patterns that might be flagged as aggressive crawling behavior.

### 5. CONTENT PARSING AND EXTRACTION

Objective:

        Extract relevant data from web pages in a structured format.

        

HTML Parsing:

Use libraries like BeautifulSoap, lxml or scrapy to parse HTML content and extract necessary elements such as titles, headings, metadata and hyperlinks

Structured Data Extraction:

If available, extract structured data (Eg: JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa) to get rich metadata about the content. This is  particularly used for semantic web applications.

        

Handling Multimedia:

Extract and store multimedia content like images, videos and embedded objects. Ensure that media files are stored in a format that allows for efficient  retrieval and processing.

### 6. SCALABILITY AND DISTRIBUTED CRAWLING

Objective:

        Scale the crawling process to handle large volumes of data and diverse web content.

        

Distributed Crawling:

Deploy the crawler across multiple machines or use cloud-based services to distribute the workload. Tools like Apache Nutch or custom solutions with distributed task queues(E.g Celery, RabbitMQ) can be used.

Load Balancing:

Implement load balancing to evenly distribute crawling tasks across multiple servers or nodes, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed.

Fault Tolerance:

Incorporate fault tolerance mechanisms to handle server failures, network issues, and timeouts. This may involve retry logic, backup systems and stateful checkpoints.

### 7. DATA STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT

Objective:

        Efficiently store and manage the vast amount of data collected by the crawler.

        

Database Selection:

Choose appropriate storage solutions based on the nature of the data. For instance, use NoSQL DB like mongodb for unstructured data or relational db like MYSQL for structured         content.
